ToListen
========
To - Listen is an application where you can make a to-do list based on artists.

Always looking for new music but don't know where to look anymore? Or are you always forgetting which artist you should listen to sometime?

* Make a list of the currently most listened artists around the world.

The fun begins when you fill in your Last.fm username.
* You get an artist randomly picked from your library.
* An overview of similar artists with the level of similarity below every artist.

Scroll through the overview and click on an artist if you like to put it on your list.
* Build your list
* Listen to them
* Check them off
* Rinse and repeat

Keep expanding your music base and keep randomizing!!
